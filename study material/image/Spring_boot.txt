Spring Boot
=================
(1)What is Spring boot
=================
Ans:   Spring Boot is an open-source, lightweight framework widely used for creating
 REST APIs and stand-alone applications with minimal configuration.

(2) What is the difference between Spring vs Spring boot?
 Ans : Spring                                                                                               Spring boot 
  ===========                                                                                        ==================
->The most important feature of spring                                      ->The most important feature of spring boot is 
framework is  dependancy injection.                                                auto configuration.
-> To run spring application we need to set                                 ->No need to set server explicitly. because spring boot has
server explicitly.                                                                                 default server like tomcat and jetty.
-> Spring an open source light weight framework                       -> Spring boot is not a open source widdly used for develop Rest Api.
widdly use for developing enterprise application.
-> To create a spring application , the developers write               -> It is reduce lines of code.
lots of code.

(3) What is the feature of Spring boot?
Ans:-> (i)  Auto configuration
           (ii)  Starter dependancy
           (iii) Temporary data base like h2 Data base
           (iv) Version management
           (v)  Security
           (vi) Default Server like tomcat and jetty

(4) What is the spring bean life cycle?
Ans:>The complete life cycle of bean is maintained by spring IOC cointainer.
->when we use @Autowired spring cointainer intiated a bean and then it perform dependency injection.
->Then init() method of bean run first and then utility method and finally destory() method.
->when the destroy method run bean life cycle comes to end.

(5) What is bean scope and it types.
Ans: 5 types of Bean Scope
(1)Singleton
=============
->only one instance of the spring bean will be created for the spring container,
   This is the default spring bean scope.
(2)Prototype
==============
->A new instance will be created everytime the bean is required from the spring container.
 (3)Request
============
->This is same as prototype scope,It is used for web applications.
->A new instance of bean will be created for each http request.
(4)Session
===========
A new will be created for each http session by the container.
(5)Global Session
=================
->This is used to create global session beans for portlet application.

(6) What is Spring security?
Ans:-Authentication:-
===================
->Authentication is the procces for knowing and Identifying the user want to access.
->it helps us to veryfying username and password wheather you authenticate user or not

 Authorization:-
============
->Authorization is the proccess to allow authority to perform actions in the applications.
->Authorizations telles which feature can be access,which feature can not be access.


(7)What is Spring profile?
Ans : Spring profiles provide a way to segregate parts of an applicationâ€™s configuration, 
allowing for different configurations to be used in different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). 
This ensures that the appropriate settings are applied based on the active profile.

(8)Annotation of Spring boot
======================

(9)What is Dependancy injection and it's type ?
Ans:It create required bean (Object)  and inject   into its reference variable automatically. it has 3 types.

                      (i) field injection
                      (ii) setter injection
                      (iii) Constructor injection

(10) What is Spring Acuator?
Ans:

(11) What is Spring Aop?
Ans:>The main purpose of AOP is to increase modularity by allowing
  the separation of cross cutting concerns.
->process of applying services as logging to our application classes
  without modifying the code. 
important Terminology:-
-----------------------
Aspect,Join point,Advice,Point cut etc

(12)What is Spring Inversion of controller(spring ioc).
Ans:->It is a place logical implementation is done.
->Spring IOC container is a core of spring framework.
->The container helps us to perform dependency injection and it is also maintain the life cycle of spring bean.

(13) What is RestFull web Service?
Ans:->Rest stands for representational state transfer.
-> Rest Apis operate on a simple request/response system.
(i) Click Server Architechture
(ii) Uniform Interface
(iii) Cachebility
(iv) Layering
(v) Statelessness.

(14) What is   Soap  vs Rest
Ans:     Soap                                                             Rest
=============                                              ==================
->Simple Object Access Protocol                 ->  Representational state transper.
->Transper data between two application  -> json,Xml.
using xml file.
-> less performance                                      -> High performance.


(15) What is Application Server vs Web Server?
Ans:   Application Server                                               Web Server
==========================                                 =============
-> If you want to build dinamic application,          -> If you want to build static application using HTML, CSS
using  technology like servlet, jsp, hibernate,          then we should go for web server.
spring boot then we use application server.

Ex:- Tomcat,JBoss, GlassFish etc.                              Ex:-  Nginx, IIS server, Google web.


(16) What is Bean Factory and Application context(ioc).
Ans:

Bean Factory                                                       Application context                                         
===============                                         =======================
>Bean Factory is the root interface       ->The application context is a sub interface of 
  for accesing the spring container.        beanfactory.it provides all the functionalities
  it provides basic functionalities            of bean factory.
  for managing beans.
