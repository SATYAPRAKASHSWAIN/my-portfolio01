HIBERNATE
==========
 (1) What is Hibernate ?

Ans : Hibernate is an open source object relation mapping(ORM)  tool that provided a framework
   to map object oriented domain model to relational database for web service.

(2) What is ORM ?

Ans : It stands for object relational mapping tool.
it is technique for converting data between relation database and object oriented 
programming language.

(3) What are the Advantages and Dis_advantages of hibernate.

Ans : Advantages
=================
(i) Caching Mechanism:
======================
           Advantage: Hibernate includes built-in caching mechanisms (first-level and second-level caches)
                                 that improve performance by reducing the number of database hits and minimizing latency.

(ii) Lazy Loading :
================
           Advantage: Hibernate supports lazy loading, which means that associated entities are loaded only 
                             when they are actually needed. This can significantly reduce memory usage and improve performance.

(iii) Transaction Management:
===========================
           Advantage: Hibernate integrates well with Java Transaction API (JTA) and the Spring Framework, 
                                   providing robust transaction management and ensuring data integrity.
(iv) Automatic ORM Mapping
=========================
          Advantage: Hibernate automatically maps Java classes to database tables and Java object 
                                properties to table columns. This reduces the need for manual mapping and simplifies the 
                                 development process.


Dis_Advantages
================
 (i) Configuration and Mapping:
===========================
          Disadvantage: Hibernate requires configuration (either XML or annotations), which can be
                        verbose and prone to errors. Misconfigurations can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug issues.

(ii) Memory Consumption:
========================
           Disadvantage: Hibernateâ€™s caching mechanisms and the way it manages objects in memory can 
                                     lead to higher memory consumption, which might be a concern in memory-constrained
                                      environments.

(4) What is HQL in hibernate?

Ans :  Hibernate Query Languge (HQL) is an object-oriented query language similar to  SQL, But
instead of operation on tables and columns, HQL works with persistent object
and their properties. HQL queries are translated by Hibernate into conventional SQL
quiries,which in turns perform action on database.

(5) What is Lagy loading Vs Eager Loading ?
Ans: Lagy loading                                                    Eager Loading
==================                                          ==================
-> In Lagy loading ,associate  data                   ->It is a design pattern which data load 
load when we explicitly call getter() or            on the spot.
size.

Ex:-Question is load when answer is load   Ex:- All Questions with answer loaded automatically
only when we call getter or size.

(6) What is Get vs Load?
Ans:    Get()                                                                                              load()
===========                                                                               =============
->It Used to fetch data from given Identifier.                  ->It Used to fetch data from given Identifier.
-> If the object not found it will throw null value          -> If the object is not fount it will throw obj. not found exception.
->get()  always hits database.                                               -> load() always not hit database.
->It is slower than load() because it will give                  -> Load is better performance compare to get().

Hibernate Life Cycle =>Transient, Persistent,Detached, Remove

interface  -> Session, SessionFactory ,Transaction

Mapping -> OneToOne ,OneToMany, ManyToONe 

Method available in Hibernate
======================================
save(), saveOrUpdate(), persist(), and update()
hibernate cache memory first level cache and secod level cache.

Hibernate Cach
================
-> Hibernate cach helps us to improve the perfomance of hibernate intraction with database.
->Every time exicute the Query we will firstly cheak for avalable data in cach,
 only the data not available in cash,then the control goes to database.
->This technic helps us out for better optimization and better perfomance.
